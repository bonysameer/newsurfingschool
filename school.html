         <h6>Surf Wala was founded in 2011 with the goal of bringing surfing to Goa. At the time there were no surf schools and no surf board rentals in Goa. By starting to teach surfing and bring in surfing equipment Surf Wala kicked off the surf scene in Goa, which now has 7 surf schools certified by the International Surfing Association and countless board rental stalls.

            Our aim is to continue to provide a high quality surfing experience to the people of Goa and to the tourists who visit the state. We select our instructors for their skill in passing on their love and knowledge of surfing to the students but also their ability to protect and care for the lives of those they are teaching and those around them in the sea.
         
            When we say that surfing is a lifestyle, we mean it. We help you to make your dream of being a surfer a reality.

            Whether you are above 60 years or have a kid below 6 years, we have trained people from all age groups and locations.
            
            Whether you know how to swim or not, we will guide you so that you can surf independently with no fear. Just like a pro surfer.</h6>
